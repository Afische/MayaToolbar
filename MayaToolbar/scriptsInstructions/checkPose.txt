CheckPose Instructions:

Purpose:
Compare character rig bone translations and rotations at two different keyframes to see if they match. 
This will ensure that game animations will seamlessly transition.
Keyframes can be compared across different Maya projects.

UI Overview: 

Current Saved File - Will display the name of the file that data was recorded from
Saved Frame Number - Will display the name of the frame number recorded
Record Data - When pressed, the translation and rotation values of all bones in the scene are recorded
Read Data - When pressed, a UI will appear to let you know if the recorded data matches the data of the frame you are currently on

How to Use:

*Ideally your scene has only one rigged character

Step1: Go to the frame that you would like to capture the pose of the character. 
Step2: Click 'Record Data' to store the translation and rotation values of the bones
